This is my first one

Y'all ever play Worldle? Well... if you are big on maps, countries, flags, and the like, you will love it.
Basically, everyday, the political outline of any given country or territory is displayed for you to guess in 6 tries or less. You get NO HINTS.

I enjoy playing on this website: https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/

Today I got it in 3 tries... I should've got it in one, but heck I guess I forgot what Nigeria looks like. Oh on second thought, you actually do get hints. After a guess, you are given an arrow emoji indicating what direction the country is relative to your guess. Also, it shows you how far away it is from your guess.

Yuhhhh.
