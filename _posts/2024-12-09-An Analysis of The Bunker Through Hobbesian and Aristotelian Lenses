<b> The Bunker </b>
The Bunker is widely considered to be the hardest level in the 2008, PlayStation
exclusive platformer, LittleBigPlanet. Appearing as one of the final levels in the story mode –
only 2 levels away from the final boss – The Bunker is renowned as the single most frustrating
level in the entire game. So much so that players have been known to give up on it.
Perhaps it is in their self-interest to step away from the game, unburdening their mind
from its virtual troubles to focus on more important matters like family or work. Or maybe
giving up would be to troubling a reality for the player. Giving into the immediate relief of
discarding the game may be too telling of how weak a person is; unable to bear moments of
discomfort to achieve a eudaimonic outcome – being that they beat the game and prove to
themselves that they are capable of fighting through difficult situations.
This was the dilemma I found myself in. Spending a week on the level, I finally beat it,
but years since, I often wonder if I made the right decision. Was it worth sacrificing homework,
family time, and personal physical health to prove that I can succeed in something seemingly so
inconsequential?
Thomas Hobbes would see my persistence as a fulfillment of desires, but a failure to
preserve oneself. In pursuit of fulfilling my desires, I gave up my physical needs, constraining
myself in a dark room, eating hardly any food and subjecting myself to the blinding light of my
television screen. A deed that Aristotle would argue as misguided. He would hold that my actions
weren’t eudaemonic at all, arguing that I failed to achieve mesotes as I fell deeper in my
isolation, forgetting to balance meaningful a pursuit of perseverance with the virtuousness of
fulfilling my responsibilities. The question of what I should have done is one I have thought
about for years but never answered. By analyzing The Bunker from a Hobbesian lens, I can find
what I did right, and from an Aristotelian perspective I can understand what I could have done
better.

<b> Hobbesian Gamer </b>
Thomas Hobbes held that in the State of Nature, man is at war with his peers, wherein all
‘solitary’ individuals seek only their own pleasure and an avoidance of pain. Threats of pain
comes from beasts and other men. Hobbes proclaims, “a perpetual and restless desire of power
after power, that ceaseth only in death” (p. 610, Hobbes, Morgan), showcasing that humans are
in perpetual and deadly contest for power to achieve their maximum pleasure, unhindered. This
natural inclination to contest for dominance, power, and pleasure was perhaps what drove me to
sacrifice so much to achieve the momentary pleasure of beating the level. I was threatened by
what giving up meant about my character, and dominance over my adversary, The Bunker, was
my natural way of proving it destroying that threat, killing it. The threat was perpetual until it
“ceaseth only in death”.
Ceaseth only in death indeed, but whose death? The Bunker or mine own? Hobbes states,
“The RIGHT OF NATURE… is the liberty each man hath, to use his own power… for the
preservation of his own nature; that is to say his own life” (p. 620 Hobbes, Morgan). Hobbes was
a proponent of reason, holding that men should act rationally in pursuit of self-preservation. He
continues to say that self-preservation consists of “doing any thing, which is in his own
judgement, and reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto”. If my week-long
struggle to beat The Bunker led to neglected responsibilities, strained relationships, and physical
deterioration, Hobbes would have certainly detested it in its irrationality. Sacrificing oneself for a
temporary sense of victory is a failure to prioritize the foundational aspects of self-preservation.
Moreover, my desire to beat the level rendered my social and physical duties as
secondary to my pleasure. I sacrificed my responsibilities, opting to engage my freedoms instead,
breaking the second and third laws of nature. I am in contract with other human beings, giving
up some freedoms to guarantee my own self-preservation under a sovereign. In 2020, when I
versed The Bunker, I was responsible to my teachers in homework, my parents in chores, and my
job in labor, yet I let it all go because I was hyper-focused on beating the level. I disregarded my
covenants with others to seek my own pleasure. Certainly, a detestable act by Hobbes. Indeed,
my pleasure is to be sought, but to achieve it at the dissolution of social covenants is not
Hobbesian at all.
How do I reconcile with having broken my covenants while remaining proud that,
ultimately, I conquered The Bunker? If the fulfillment of beating the level enhanced my self-
confidence, resilience, and ability to tackle future challenges, then perhaps Hobbes might view
the pursuit as a rational self-interest. However, if making my responsibilities secondary broke
covenants I had with others, then the level was not worth it.

<b>Aristotelian Gamer</b>
Aristotle held that ‘telos’ is what humans strive for in their actions. Telos is the ultimate
goal of our actions, and what makes those actions virtuous is ‘mesotes’, the act of moderating
our actions to find a median action. Moreover, Aristotle argues that the median action is the most
virtuous. A person who conducts himself with mesotes is on a path eudaemonia, the state of
fulfilling one’s potential and achieving happiness.
Viewing my actions, Aristotle might see my perseverance in versing The Bunker as
virtuous. However, he would promptly look past that to realize that spending a week, isolated in
a dark room, trying to beat a video game level, did not achieve mesotes. Furthermore, in trying to
succeed in LittleBigPlanet, I disregarded higher virtues. If my decision was guided by reason and
moderation – balancing my gaming challenge with responsibilities like family, health, and
homework – Aristotle might argue that I acted virtuously, but my negligence suggest a lack of
practical reasoning with my actions manifesting in excess.
However, even if I played the game in moderation, would Aristotle argue that it is
virtuous? Say I played the game once a week for 30 minutes; I’d argue that Aristotle would still
regard it as unvirtuous. This is because eudaemonia is more than the individual. It is more than
the desires of a single person. On the contrary of Hobbes, self-interest is not what shapes man or
the state. Rather, the state, the polis, is of fulfilling virtue and achieving eudaemonia; it is the
ultimate goal of humans because we are political animals. Thus, I failed to commit any virtuous
action because I failed to reach the first phase of the city state which is family. I did not interact
with my family at all in that week of machining that poor PlayStation 3. Moreover, I set aside all
of my societal responsibilities, the second phase (the village) of arriving to the city state, the
polis.
For Aristotle, eudaemonia is achieved by living a life in accordance with reason and
practicing virtues that contribute to the highest good. My decision to persist with The Bunker
may reflect a virtuous character trait — the courage to endure frustration and difficulty — but
Aristotle would detest my failure to balance this with my broader responsibilities. While beating
the level may have felt like a personal triumph, the neglect of homework, family, and physical
health was simply a failure to prioritize the highest goods in life. Thus, from an Aristotelian
perspective, my decision was ultimately misguided, as it disrupted the harmony necessary for
eudaemonia.
Virtue lies in mesotes, and true fulfillment comes from aligning one’s actions with the
telos. The joy of beating The Bunker could be part of a flourishing life, but only if pursued in
balance with higher priorities. My actions ultimately proved to be more hedonic than
eudaemonic. A virtuous life requires not just achieving small victories, but ensuring the victories
serve the broader goal of eudaimonia and the polis.

<b>Who Wins?</b>
Well… If we are talking about The Bunker; I win. But if we are talking about whose
philosophy perseveres, and offers a greater understanding of my actions, then they both win.
Pardon me as I offer a brief message to the philosophers: Congratulations.
Firstly, Thomas Hobbes made me understand why I did what I did. It all makes sense now. Of
course I felt the need to assert my dominance. It is in my human nature to do so at a perceived
threat. However, although I fulfilled my natural human tendency, I did not do so in the right way
according to Hobbes and Aristotle.
For Hobbes, breaking the covenants I made with my school, work, and family was a
detestable act which debased my case for beating the level as the right thing to do. For Aristotle,
even my perseverance was not a virtue, for I committed it in excess. In my persistence, I
neglected the higher virtues of spending time with my family and fulfilling my duties. Herein, I
failed to achieve the first and second phases of the polis. After all, the polis is the ultimate
eudaemonic pursuit.
In the future, I will work to balance actions with duties, ensuring that hedonic temptations
to fulfill my self-interest do not come at the expense of higher virtues like family, health, and
work. By instilling mesotes in my actions, I will aim for a virtuous life in alignment with
Aristotle’s eudaimonia and Hobbes’s rational self-interest. This approach will help me maintain
harmony between individual achievements and societal responsibilities.
