Boy, oh boy...

It may just be me, but why do I feel like I can't improve myself in public - or rather the public eye. I feel like I should only show myself to the world when I'm complete. When the Tameem Suleiman project has concluded. When I have made my findings, and find myself as the proof therein. Only until I have healed on the inside; can I go outside.

I have a skewed perception of what it means to be human. Let's list why:

1. Too much TV
2. Too much social media
3. Too much self-awareness

I will not dwell on these points seperately, instead I'll explain the overarching reason for my skewed perception of self-improvement - tying these points into it.

As a first generation iPad kid, seldom do I go outside. This means my perception of reality, and the people therein, is forced onto the atypical by unrealistically portrayed images. Every person I see on social media or television is already successful. I have no reference of these individuals outside of this displayed reality, thus I've developed unreal expecations for myself.

"The grind" is something I've only done in private. Why? Because I've never seen anyone do it in public! Hardly do I see someone struggling for success. When I go into the real world - yes the "real world" because the internet is a world in and of itself aaaaand it's FAKE - I don't see people struggling; they're just living life.

Okay I've been delaying Isha Salah I'm gonna cut this post short. السلام عليكم
